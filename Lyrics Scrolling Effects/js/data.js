[00:05.23]Honest (feat. moon tang)
[00:10.23]
[00:22.23]Honest
[00:23.27]Don't know why I keep trying
[00:25.96]When everybody famous
[00:28.36]Says fame is not the greatest
[00:32.61]Honest
[00:33.94]It's too hard to be honest
[00:36.52]When everybody's faking
[00:39.27]And all they feel is vacant
[00:42.51]But what would I be
[00:45.25]If I said I'ma stop?
[00:48.18]How can I dream
[00:49.83]When I gotta wake up?
[00:52.39]In the city of millions
[00:56.95]Millions
[00:58.56]Don't be sad
[00:59.81]If I'm just not the one
[01:02.98]In the city of millions
[01:07.67]Millions
[01:09.99]I'll just keep pushing my luck
[01:13.91]Until I give up
[01:19.20]Until I give up
[01:24.62]Until I give up
[01:29.99]Until I give up
[01:35.86]I'm overthinking too much
[01:38.52]Thinking that I can't do enough
[01:41.33]Wrote too many songs about love
[01:43.95]So I never really learned to grow up
[01:46.80]I don't wanna be young, rich and famous
[01:49.61]If I can't still be myself
[01:52.44]So until my music gets all famous
[01:54.90]I'll spend more time on myself
[01:57.34]So what would I be
[01:59.92]If I said I'ma stop?
[02:02.87]How can I dream
[02:04.51]When I gotta wake up
[02:06.93]In the city of millions
[02:11.02]Millions
[02:13.03]Don't be sad
[02:14.31]If I'm just not the one
[02:17.54]In the city of millions
[02:21.78]Millions
[02:24.30]I'll just keep pushing my luck
[02:28.68]Until I give up
[02:33.98]Until I give up
[02:39.25]Until I give up
[02:44.64]Until I give up
[02:47.29]Until I give up
